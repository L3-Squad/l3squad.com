      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">2. Chrome Extension – L3 Tab Toggle</h2>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mb-2">2.1 Purpose of the Extension</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The L3 Tab Toggle Chrome extension is a simple productivity tool intended primarily for internal L3 Squad members. It helps users quickly switch or manage browser tabs to improve focus and workflow.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mb-2">2.2 Data collection by the Extension</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The Extension:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>Does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information</li>
        <li>Does not collect browsing history, page content, keystrokes, or form data</li>
        <li>Does not use cookies, trackers, or analytics</li>
        <li>Does not send any data to L3 Squad servers or third‑party servers</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">
        All actions performed by the Extension occur locally in your browser.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        If this changes in the future (for example, if a new version needs to send limited data for functionality), we will update this Privacy Policy and the Chrome Web Store listing to clearly describe what is collected and why.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">3. How we use your information</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We use the information described above for purposes such as:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>Coordinating volunteers, mentors, and learners</li>
        <li>Organizing sessions, events, and learning programs</li>
        <li>Communicating with you about opportunities, updates, and support</li>
        <li>Improving our educational programs, community, and Website</li>
        <li>Ensuring security and preventing misuse or abuse of our services</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We do not sell your personal information.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We do not use your information for third‑party advertising.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">4. Sharing of information</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We may share your information in limited, controlled situations:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>With core L3 Squad organizers who need the information to manage programs and communication</li>
        <li>With other volunteers, mentors, or partner organizations when reasonably necessary to match you with an opportunity or coordinate an activity (for example, sharing your email with a session co‑host), and where possible with your awareness</li>
        <li>With service providers who help us run our Website, forms, communication tools, or storage (e.g., Google, email services), who process data on our behalf</li>
        <li>When required by law, legal process, or a valid request from a government or regulatory authority</li>
        <li>When necessary to protect the rights, safety, or security of our learners, volunteers, or community</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We do not share Extension data with any party because, as described above, the Extension does not collect personal data.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">5. Data retention</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We keep personal information only for as long as is reasonably necessary to:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>Operate and improve L3 Squad programs and community</li>
        <li>Stay in contact with you as a volunteer, learner, or supporter</li>
        <li>Fulfill legal, accounting, or reporting obligations, if any</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">
        If you no longer want to be associated with L3 Squad or want us to delete your information, you can contact us (see “Contact us” below). Subject to any legal requirements, we will delete or anonymize your information within a reasonable time.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">6. Security</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect the information we hold, including:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>Restricting access to form responses and internal documents to relevant organizers</li>
        <li>Using password‑protected accounts and access controls on third‑party services</li>
        <li>Periodic review of who has access to volunteer and participant information</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">
        However, no method of data storage or transmission over the internet is completely secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">7. Children’s privacy</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Many of the learners we aim to serve are young students.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Our volunteer and mentor sign‑up forms, Website contact forms, and the L3 Tab Toggle Extension are primarily intended for adults or individuals who are legally allowed to provide their own information.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We do not knowingly collect personal information from children without appropriate consent from a parent/guardian or as permitted by applicable law.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        If you believe a child has provided personal information to us without appropriate consent, please contact us so we can review and, where appropriate, delete the information.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">8. International data transfers</h2>
